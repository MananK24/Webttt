													</p>
													<span class="image main"><img src="images/f2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
													<p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.</p>
													<p><strong>Most common symptoms: </strong></p>
													<ul><li>Fever.</li>
														<li>Dry cough.</li>
														<li>Tiredness.</li>
													</ul>
													<p><strong>Less common symptoms: </strong></p>

													</ul><p><strong>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.</strong>  </p>
													<p>Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. 
														People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. 
														On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</p>

												<h2 class="major">Myths And Facts</h2>
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/g1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<p>Will most people who get COVID-19 get very sick or die? </p>
												<p>FACT: Most people who get COVID­-19 will have a mild form of the illness and recover without needing professional medical care. Around eight out of every 10 people with COVID­-19 will have mild symptoms. Around one in six people will become severely ill and need hospital care. Scientific modelling suggests that around 1 in 100 people who get COVID-19 will die. </p>
												<p>Can you always tell if someone has COVID-19? </p>
												<p>FACT: No The virus can be in someone’s body for up to 14 days before they get symptoms, and some people will have such a mild case of COVID-19 that they might not notice that anything is wrong. That’s why it’s important that everyone follows government advice – including hand washing, using tissues to catch coughs and sneezes, and avoiding crowds – to stop the spread of the virus, even if they feel healthy. </p>
												<p>Does COVID-19 only affect old people, meaning young people don’t have to worry? </p>
												<p>FACT: While COVID-19 can be more dangerous in older people, anyone can get it including young people, some of whom become seriously ill. While we don’t yet fully understand why some people get more serious symptoms, we do know that young people are more likely to develop serious symptoms if they have certain underlying health conditions, for example asthma, heart conditions or untreated HIV.  </p>
												<p>Are people living with HIV more likely to get seriously ill? </p>
												<p>FACT: If you are living with HIV and on effective treatment there's no evidence that you are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 symptoms. This is because your treatment will be keeping your immune system strong and your body able to deal with infections. If you are worried that you might have HIV, now is a good time to get tested so you can start treatment if you need it.  </p>
												<p>Will antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV stop me getting COVID-19?  </p>
												<p>FACT: There is no evidence that taking anti-HIV drugs will stop you getting COVID-19. Although some ART drugs are being trialled for use to treat COVID-19, there is no evidence yet that they are effective for this purpose. 
													If you are living with HIV and taking treatment it’s important that you follow the general advice to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Keep taking your treatment to ensure your immune system stays strong. You shouldn’t share your HIV drugs with anyone else who has COVID-19 or is worried about getting it. These should only be taken if prescribed by a doctor.  </p>
												<p>Can COVID-19 spread in warm sunny weather? </p>
												<p>FACT: COVID-19 can survive temperatures higher than 25C. You can catch it no matter how sunny and warm it is. So, whatever the weather you should follow the official advice to protect yourself from the virus. 
													Getting out into the sunshine, if you can, is still a good idea as this helps your body produce vitamin D which is important for your immune system.  </p>
												<p>Will drinking lots of hot drinks stop COVID-19? </p>
												<p>FACT: There is no drink hot or cold that will protect you from COVID-19 or cure the illness. So far, there’s no proven cure for COVID-19 but most people recover by themselves. Taking paracetamol, drinking lots of liquids, and getting enough rest can help you manage your symptoms.  </p><p>Should I use a strong disinfectant to clean my hands and body to protect myself from COVID-19? </p><p>FACT: You shouldn’t use strong disinfectant to clean your body. Washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water or rubbing an alcohol-based sanitizer on them will stop the virus spreading. Using stronger chemicals on your skin can be dangerous. Never drink disinfectant or hand sanitizer as this can do serious damage. </p><p>Can Chloroquine cure COVID-19? </p><p>FACT: At the moment there is no proven cure for COVID-19, but most people will recover on their own without needing professional medical care. If you think you have COVID-19 and are having difficulty breathing, contact your local health facility as you will need professional medical care. 
													As scientists and doctors continue their work to understand and treat COVID-19 our knowledge of, and ability to treat and prevent the virus will improve. For now, it’s important to follow official government advice and get information only from reliable sources like Avert.org, the World Health Organization (WHO) or your government’s health department.</p>

								<p><strong>PFIZER'S COVID 19 VACCINE</strong></p>
								<p>The success of Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine trial may help persuade more people to get inoculated amid a surge in new coronavirus cases, according to Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease doctor. 
								Pfizer’s vaccine, developed in collaboration with Germany’s BioNTech SE, has “an extraordinarily high degree of efficacy -- more than 90%, close to 95%,” Fauci said in an interview. That could be a key factor in overcoming reluctance to take pandemic vaccines that have been developed at top speed.</p>

								<p>Moderna Inc has announced that Switzerland has started a rolling review of mRNA-1273, the company’s vaccine candidate against COVID-19, so that it can give it a speedy approval should the vaccine pass muster in clinical trials. Regulator Swissmedic is already scrutinizing the progress of experimental vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca as well as Pfizer and BioNTech SE in similar rolling reviews.</p>

								<p>On 12th November 2020 BioNtech announced their mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, against SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated evidence of efficacy against COVID-19 in participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted on November 8, 2020 by an external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) from the Phase 3 clinical study.</p>

														<p><b style="background-color: initial;">1. The most official: the <a href="https://www.who.int/">WHO's COVID-19 Dashboard</a></b></p>
														<p>Taking the lead in global healthcare, the WHO’s dashboard offers the most official COVID-19 numbers on the internet. It allows you to explore the global data of each country from deaths to reported cases in an interactive fashion. </p>
														<p><strong>2. The most user-friendly: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">Worldometer Live Coronavirus Update</a> </strong></p>
														<p>If you want a no-frills approach to the numbers, then the Worldometer Live Coronavirus Update is where you head. The first three numbers to greet you are straight to the point: positive cases, deaths, recovered cases. Details of individual countries and source links are easy to access by scrolling down the one-pager. </p>
														<p><strong>3. The earliest dashboard: <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 Dashboard </a></strong></p>
														<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, Johns Hopkins put together an online COVID-19 dashboard in 3 days back in January when the virus was “merely” an outbreak. The dashboard’s approach quickly picked up steam to set the standard of what to expect out of such a dashboard: interactive world map, detailed stats and transparency regarding sources.</p>
														<p><strong>4. All the data: <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a></strong></p>
														<p>Al Jazeera, literally "The Island", though referring to the Arabian Peninsula in context) is a state-owned broadcaster based in Doha, Qatar, owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network. Initially launched as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages.</p>
														<p><strong>5. News with a personal touch: </strong><a href="https://scroll.in/"><strong>Scroll.in</strong></a></p>
														<p>Scroll.in, simply referred to as Scroll, is an Indian Hindi and English language digital news publication owned by the Scroll Media Incorporation. Founded in 2014, the website and its journalists have won several national and international awards including four Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards and the CPJ International Press Freedom Awards.</p>
